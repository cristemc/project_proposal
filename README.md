## Research Question
*How accessible is publicly available broadband access?* Federal, state, and local governemnts leverage billions of dollars and partnerships with private-industry partners to make broadband more accessible and increase adoption rates at home. These programs often fund publicly accessible broadband through public schools and libraries to aid children and their families to get online in an effort to increase educational outcomes leading to more economic opportunities. A primary example is the FCC's E-RATE universal services program, which provides funds for obtaining and implementing broadband in school and libraries across urban and rural disctricts. In addition to these access points, private businesses often provide free wifi to customers. Dispite the many access points, barriers still exist: including hours of operation, environment, and purchase requirements. 
### Why it matters
As our society has moved online, we have begun the process of reproducing the current systems of inequality into the digital dimension. This is demonstrated by current broadband adoption rates and academic performance seen across income levels and racial groups. In an article from the Washington Center for Equitable Growth found that 31.4 percent of household with an annual income lower than $50,000 with school-aged children lacked broadband access in their homes. Furthermore, regardless of income levels Black and Latinx children disproportionately lack access when compared to white and Asian children (Crampton, 2018). This creates a *homework gap* between those who have access at home to support their studies, and those who do not (Yankelevich et al., 2017). Considering that 94% of all school districts serving low-income students report assigning internet-based homeowrk (Shapiro, 2015), the need for broadband becomes alarming clear. Some may suggest that the solution is as simple as giving every student a wifi-enabled laptop, but this far from a solution to a problem that exists within an interconnected ecosystem of hurdles built on a historical oppression. In most surveys regarding broadband access
